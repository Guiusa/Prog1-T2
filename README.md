<h3>A implementation of pile, queue and list abstract types of data</h3>
<p>
> By running "make" on a linux terminal in this directory, you will generate 3 executables named "testa_pilha.o", "testa_fila.o" and "testa_lista.o".<br>
> Each of the executables will test the pile, queue and list types of data. You can execute them by typing "./testa_{fila,lista,pilha}<br>
> The "make" command will generate some executable files on your directory, to clear all of them, type "make clean"
